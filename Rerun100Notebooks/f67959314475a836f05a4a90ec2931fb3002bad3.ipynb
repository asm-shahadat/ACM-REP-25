So the total number of elements pushed to the queue will be 2$^N + 2^N-1$, which is asymptotically equivalent to $O(2^N)$. While processing each element, we do need to concatenate the current string with `(` or `)`. This operation will take $O(N)$, so the overall time complexity of our algorithm will be $O(N*2^N)$. This is not completely accurate but reasonable enough to be presented in the interview. The actual time complexity ( $O(4^n/\\sqrt{n})$  ) is bounded by the **[Catalan number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number)** and is beyond the scope of a coding interview.
